A fun Mastering the Mainframe Grand Challenge code submission

## Info

This uses the vast Figlet Librery of ASCII fonts, and Termcolor to allow
a user to turn any string of text into a work of art

       
## Requirements & Setup

  ### Requirements
   Python Verion >= 3.0
  
  ### Setup
   Install nessecary Modules:
   1. Termcolor ---> ```pip install termcolor```
   2. PyiFiglet ---> ```pip install pyfiglet```
   3. Tablulate ---> ```pip install tabulate``` 
   4. Download ----> ```txtart.py```  
    
## USAGE
  Users will be asked to choose a font from the listed table of fonts, then they can type in 
  the text they want to be artified. Lastly the user will be asked to pick from a list of colors 
  for their text to be displayed in. 
  At any point a user can type 'quit' to exit the program.
  Fell free to try and break the code there are fun eater egg failsafes implemented.

## AUTHORS
  
  pyfiglet is a *port* of FIGlet, and much of the code is directly translated
  from the C source. The original authors of FIGlet are listed on their website at
  http://www.figlet.org/. The origal author of Termcolor is Konstantin Lepa. Find out more details at 
  https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/. Tabluate was created by a pool of authors, but was spearhead by
  Sergey Astanin, their hompages is https://pypi.org/project/tabulate/.
